## Notes & Decisions

### **Architecture Decisions**

- **Modular Design**: Each service is independent and can be developed/tested separately
- **Event-Driven**: All communication through structured events for loose coupling
- **Local Processing**: No cloud dependencies for privacy and reliability
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without advanced features
- **Local Sentience Development**: Using local `temp-sentience` repository for parallel development and customization

### **Technical Debt**

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Add monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Create configuration management
- [ ] Add database migrations

### **Future Considerations**

- [ ] Multi-language support
